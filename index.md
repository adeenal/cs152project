# Title: Image Captioning

## Project Description

I will focus on training neural networks to automatically generate captions for images. Using a Kaggle data set that comes from Wikipedia, I will create an English-based training data set for the neural network. Since the training data is about 275GB, I will have testing data that are just samples of the training data, as well as possibly have some limitations to filter out some data.

I will train the neural network on one training data set, cleaning it or using other training data sets as well if needed. The trained neural network will then be "deployed" as an application by running the neural network with the testing data. The longer-term goal is to use the neural network to caption or label any given image.

## Project Goals

1. Create data sets for training and testing neural networks that creates captions for images
2. Explore methods for cleaning the training and test data sets
3. Train a neural network that is able to caption any image
